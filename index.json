When using my iPhone for instance, I can take a photo vertically holding my phone with the home button at the bottom, I can take a photo with the home button oriented to the left or the right, I could even take a photo with the home button at the top - my phone upside down.\nWhen one takes a snap on a modern device, the device itself will factor in orientation and store a little snippet of information along with the image in what\u0026rsquo;s called Exif metadata. So when I\u0026rsquo;m flicking through the gallery on my phone, I tend to see my images oriented correctly. When I transfer them to my computer, the same is true when I\u0026rsquo;m looking at them in the file system. Both devices know that despite the orientation of my phone at the time of taking the picture, I want to see the image as it was taken in reality. This is the most common expected user experience, and our devices are very good at intuiting how we\u0026rsquo;d like to see these images.\nThat said, here\u0026rsquo;s a photo of a duck:\nMy phone and laptop know to show me this image the right way up, but Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t (yet).\nThe above photo was added directly to my site offline via a text editor. A simple copy and paste from one folder to another. No magic is happening, because there\u0026rsquo;s no room for it to.\nNext, we\u0026rsquo;ll try adding the same image via Forestry (HugoModo\u0026rsquo;s benchmark for compatibility):\nThe same image again, still displayed with incorrect orientation by default. And it looks as though Forestry currently lacks native image editing or processing capabilities (although it sounds like they have it in the works, as well).\nWe have some options\u0026hellip; Hugo\u0026rsquo;s image processing functionality does already provide the possibility to rotate images, but this must currently be done manually and per image - as noted above, it seems Hugo yet lacks awareness of Exif info. This could be a cumbersome undertaking for an end user with a photo gallery on their site, particularly if they have no development experience.\nHugo is set to gain that information, with a working implementation already. But it looks like we\u0026rsquo;re waiting on an upstream bugfix before it finds its way into a release.\nSo I will revisit this at that time.\nFortunately, for now, there is another way. Forestry have a partnership with the actually phenomenal image storage service, Cloudinary who I believe handle this issue by default.\nOne final test. Here\u0026rsquo;s that duck again:\nOops. The orientation of our duck here was corrected in both Forestry and Cloudinary\u0026rsquo;s media dashboards, but is still showing sideways in our content.\nSo as a final correction, it looks like we still have to adjust that URL. Not ideal. But this is where Cloudinary shines.\nCloudinary takes a parameter for the angle of an image like so:\nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/example/a_90/image.jpg  The a_90 tells Cloudinary we want that image rotated 90 degrees, and it will serve us just that.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t what we want in this case, as Cloudinary displays the image corrected by default, at least in the dashboard. So we add a_0 instead, to tell Cloudinary we want this image served the right way up:\nHey presto!\nIs this ideal? No. It still took some work to get us to this point, where we\u0026rsquo;d like to just upload our images and have 0 degrees be considered the default orientation.\nI will continue to look into this.\n","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/blog/exif-orientation/","tags":null,"title":"Exif Orientation"},{"categories":null,"contents":"HugoModo is a collection of themes and extensions for the Hugo static site generator.

It is. There are a lot of blog posts from others online with setups that vary in complexity. None are as simple as this:\n# Clean and don\u0026#39;t fail install: - rm -rf public || exit 0 # Build the website script: - bin/hugo deploy: provider: pages skip-cleanup: true github-token: $GITHUB_TOKEN # Set in the settings page of your repository, as a secure variable keep-history: true local-dir: public repo: hugomodo/hugomodo.github.io allow-empty-commit: true target-branch: master on: branch: master This is mostly TravisCI\u0026rsquo;s own suggested configuration for publishing to GitHub Pages, with the exception of adding the local-dir, repo, allow-empty-commit and target-branch options. These tell Travis to publish the contents of public to our separate GitHub Pages repo at hugomodo/hugomodo.github.io and to push those contents to the master branch. allow-empty-commit: true is added in case of build failure, so that the site can be rebuilt without changes.\nThe only other required setup is to add a GitHub token to the repo config in TravisCI, and provide Hugo as a binary in the bin folder.\n","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/docs/build-with-forestry/","tags":null,"title":"Build with Forestry"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One of the core principles of HugoModo is to stick to the Hugo way of doing things where possible and sensible to do so. This reduces the likelihood of incompatibility, and should make for greater ease of use for anyone familiar with Hugo or working from the Hugo documentation.\nOf course, HugoModo deliberately does a lot differently, emphasising the principle of Convention over Configuration where Hugo otherwise emphasises speed. The aim is to achieve a comfortable middle-ground that remains blazing fast, but that also provides for greater ease of use and extension.\nI just don\u0026rsquo;t yet know what to do about Chroma.\nChroma is Hugo\u0026rsquo;s in-built syntax highlighter, for rendering beautiful code samples like this one:\n{{ if .IsPage }} {{ .Content }} {{ end }} At the time of writing, this code sample is being interpreted by Chroma and displayed with inline style declarations.\nChroma has a couple of different flavours though. The default is these inline styles, but Hugo also provides a configuration option and CSS generator to serve Chroma syntax highlighting with classes used and styles served from a separate stylesheet.\nThing is, neither of these approaches is really the HugoModo way.\nAnother principle of HugoModo is HTML minimalism. By this I mean that the markup is intended to be clear of style declarations and class attributes. Unless strictly necessary, I believe that HTML should be free from both, with a CSS file doing the heavy lifting to style a page. If necessary later, an additional script should be invoked to inline above-the-fold styles, for instance. The point is separation of scope in development: HTML files should be strictly markup, CSS should have almost total authority when it comes to styling.\nHugoModo will continue to support Chroma for now. But I am beginning to wonder\u0026hellip; is it the HugoModo way?\n","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/blog/the-trouble-with-chroma/","tags":null,"title":"The Trouble With Chroma, Hugo's Syntax Highlighting Library"},{"categories":null,"contents":" What\u0026rsquo;s the issue? HugoModo strives for third-party compatibility. The baseline for this is currently Forestry CMS. When asking the question, \u0026ldquo;does it work with Forestry CMS?\u0026rdquo; of the Image Processing extension, the answer was not yes - it was mostly.\nThe problem is, Forestry is unaware of shortcodes. These could be hand-typed by a developer easily, but when it comes to non-technical authors adding images to content, they probably aren\u0026rsquo;t going to do that. And as a matter of usability, I also prefer to use the GUI to add content to a post. On Forestry, this results in a markdown declaration.\nNo assessment of the size of the image is performed, and so the result is the raw output of - more than likely - an oversized image.\nHugoModo Image Processing aims to circumvent that issue with an interpreter of its own for outputting content. But while this interpreter then succeeds in producing resized image resources, it breaks all of the other shortcodes that can be used in Hugo.\nThe solution HugoModo Shortcode Partials aims to provide all of the existing Hugo shortcodes as partials, as well as an override for content interpretation. This solves the problem above, and provides a clear best practise for adding additional shortcodes.\nThis is not recommended Where absolutely possible, it is better to do without overriding Hugo\u0026rsquo;s own .Content function. Using this shim and/or the Image Processing override may lead to a severe decrease in performance.\nIt is provided as a convenience, for anywhere markdown reinterpretation is preferred.\n","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/extensions/shortcode-partials/","tags":null,"title":"Shortcode Partials"},{"categories":null,"contents":"HugoModo is designed to be compatible with the static site, headless CMS, Forestry.\nWhen you first hook a site up with Forestry, it assumes the same default behaviour that HugoModo does. In particular, this means images are stored in the static directory and are exempt from image processing.\nBut Forestry has offered configuration for using a content directory instead for quite a while now. Enabling this feature will store uploads as page resources, and will allow for the use of Hugo\u0026rsquo;s in-built image processing.\nThis can be activated in HugoModo by installing the HugoModo Image Processing extension.\nBy default, HugoModo Image Processing will assume the use of page bundles to store images. This is the de facto Hugo way, but is currently unsupported by Forestry. But just one extra step gets us to where we need to be.\nHugoModo Image Processing can be configured to look for and use any content directory for image resources.\nTo turn this on, simply add a file at data/imageProcessing/config.toml with the content:\nuploadsDir = \u0026quot;uploads\u0026quot;  This can be any path you like, but the folder should exist in your site\u0026rsquo;s content directory, and should contain an index.md set to act as a headless bundle.\nThe following image has been uploaded in Forestry\u0026rsquo;s dashboard:\nUnfortunately, inline images cannot be added via the Forestry dashboard and handled automatically by HugoModo\u0026rsquo;s image processing shortcodes.\nThis is something I am looking to remedy.

The aim is to follow certain best practices. We want to keep markup to a minimum, and where possible to only use HTML5\u0026rsquo;s semantic elements (\u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;section\u0026rsquo;, etc. rather than \u0026lsquo;div\u0026rsquo;). And the foot partial is provided mainly to load scripts after the main content, so as to provide for fast page rendering to visitors.\nThe Hugo Way \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; {{- partial \u0026#34;head.html\u0026#34; . -}} \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{- partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . -}} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- block \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; . }}{{- end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . -}} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; The HugoModo Way \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; {{- partial \u0026#34;head.html\u0026#34; . -}} \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{- partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . -}} {{- block \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; . }}{{- end }} {{- partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . -}} {{- partial \u0026#34;foot.html\u0026#34; . -}} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Theme Partial Organisation Hugo themes are easy to extend and make adjustments to by overwriting partials. Many themes however are comprised of partials that do an enormous amount. In order to change one small detail, the entire partial must be copied across. And if the base theme then receives an update, it can be a chore to find small changes in those files to upgrade your child theme or site.\nHugoModo aims to solve this problem by reducing partials to tightly scoped directories. Rather than having one \u0026lsquo;head\u0026rsquo; partial, HugoModo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;head\u0026rsquo; calls on many child partials in partials/head. Any one can be overwritten without throwing the rest of the theme out of sync with the upstream, meaning easier upgrades and lower maintenance over time.\nList Pages Because Hugo builds sites that reflect the directory structure of its content files precisely, it is easy to create deeply nested pages.\nThere is no list page behaviour by default, but the standard practise is to just list .RegularPages for each section. However, this is a poor reflection of Hugo\u0026rsquo;s fuller capabilities which allows for sections inside of sections, and deeply nested collections of pages.\nHugoModo includes a default list template that combines and sorts a section\u0026rsquo;s child sections and pages, listing and paginating them together.\nSuperior Asset Bundling Hugo hasn\u0026rsquo;t always had great support for CSS and JavaScript assets. It still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the greatest, but it\u0026rsquo;s moving in the right direction.\nHugoModo gives Hugo a gentle nudge slightly further. It uses Hugo\u0026rsquo;s support for data files to provide a single location where JavaScript and SASS resources may be listed. The included js and scss resource partials read these resource lists, concatenate and minify the named files.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a lot like Ruby\u0026rsquo;s Bundler, or NPM. Basically a pseudo package manager for Hugo. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nAnd this is where HugoModo gets truly modular. Regardless of how many child themes or extensions you invoke in your site, the resource bundler collects all of the associated assets and bundles them for you.\n","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/blog/hugo-goes-modular/","tags":null,"title":"Hugo Goes Modular"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/docs/","tags":null,"title":"Docs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/extensions/","tags":null,"title":"Extensions"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://hugomodo.github.io/themes/","tags":null,"title":"Themes"}]
