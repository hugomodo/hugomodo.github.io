      <description>When you take with your camera or phone, you can do so holding the device at any of four orientations. When using my iPhone for instance, I can take a photo vertically holding my phone with the home button at the bottom, I can take a photo with the home button oriented to the left or the right, I could even take a photo with the home button at the top - my phone upside down.</description>

      <title>The Trouble With Chroma, Hugo&#39;s Syntax Highlighting Library</title>

      <description>One of the core principles of HugoModo is to stick to the Hugo way of doing things where possible and sensible to do so. This reduces the likelihood of incompatibility, and should make for greater ease of use for anyone familiar with Hugo or working from the Hugo documentation.
Of course, HugoModo deliberately does a lot differently, emphasising the principle of Convention over Configuration where Hugo otherwise emphasises speed. The aim is to achieve a comfortable middle-ground that remains blazing fast, but that also provides for greater ease of use and extension.</description>

      <title>Forestry Compatible</title>
      <link>https://hugomodo.github.io/blog/forestry-compatible/</link>

      <description>HugoModo is designed to be compatible with the static site, headless CMS, Forestry.
When you first hook a site up with Forestry, it assumes the same default behaviour that HugoModo does. In particular, this means images are stored in the static directory and are exempt from image processing.
But Forestry has offered configuration for using a content directory instead for quite a while now. Enabling this feature will store uploads as page resources, and will allow for the use of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s in-built image processing.</description>

      <title>Hugo Goes Modular</title>

      <description>A Better Base HugoModo removes the main content div from Hugo&amp;rsquo;s default base template, and adds a new partial called the &amp;lsquo;foot&amp;rsquo;. The aim is to follow certain best practices. We want to keep markup to a minimum, and where possible to only use HTML5&amp;rsquo;s semantic elements (&amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;section&amp;rsquo;, etc. rather than &amp;lsquo;div&amp;rsquo;). And the foot partial is provided mainly to load scripts after the main content, so as to provide for fast page rendering to visitors.</description>
