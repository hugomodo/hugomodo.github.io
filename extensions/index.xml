      <title>Shortcode Partials</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the issue? HugoModo strives for third-party compatibility. The baseline for this is currently Forestry CMS. When asking the question, &amp;ldquo;does it work with Forestry CMS?&amp;rdquo; of the Image Processing extension, the answer was not yes - it was mostly.
The problem is, Forestry is unaware of shortcodes. These could be hand-typed by a developer easily, but when it comes to non-technical authors adding images to content, they probably aren&amp;rsquo;t going to do that.</description>
